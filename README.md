#Tasks:
Carefully read the given task. Marks are often needlessly lost by not delivering what is
requested.

You are required to demonstrate your comprehension of a number of Design Patterns that
you have studied in this module. To be able to complete this assessment it is important that
you attend the lectures to participate and engage when the presented case studies will be
discussed. A systematic study/work pattern following every lecture will be an important step
for the completion of this task. You should choose three cases (one case from each of
the three presented scenarios: see section on Scenarios) and demonstrate your
understanding of the design pattern that is best suited. You must submit a report,
demonstration video/walkthrough of the implementation and a copy of the error-free
source code (for all three implementations).
There is good scope for creativity and full credit will only be given to those solutions that
present a complete understanding of the design pattern(s) within a fully functional system.


The report (500 - 700 wordsâ€™) must contain the following sections:
Section 1 (Specifications): for the pattern that you have used in the implementation of the
scenario that you submit, a write-up of the way that you have used the design pattern within
the context of your chosen Case.
Section 2 (OOP Design): expanded class diagram, along with the (pseudo-)code in which
you have applied the design pattern in a way that underlines your comprehension of its or
their use.
Section 3 (Discussion): justify why the chosen design pattern is/are best suited for the
given Case. Contrast your discussion against the pattern of similar purpose.





Scenarios

Scenario 1
Case 1:
As an entrepreneur, you are seeking to initiate a start-up called CoolOS that will produce
budget-friendly operating systems with pre-loaded applications designed and developed for
specific age groups (for example age 7-12 or age 13-16). You are hopeful that this start-up
will lead to the development of more such age-specific operating systems once people see
the advantages and the cost efficiency.
OR
Case 2:
In a virtual Kingdom called MyOwnKingdom, people started promoting themselves as the
King, which resulted in chaos. You are invited to re-program this virtual Kingdom to allow
only one King to exist at any point of time even if people promoted and called themselves as
Kings. A new King can be in place only if the existing King died or lost his Kingdom to
another King in a war.

Scenario 2
Case 3:
Net Estate Agents is a real estate agency in Aberdare. Its vision is to promote a healthy
communication network among all the people who use the services of Net Estate to either
rent or buy a property. However, according to the agency this resulted in a difficult-to-handle
communication complexity. To maintain a well-functioning system, the owner has hired you
to re-program the network in such a way that all communication will be channelled through
the Agency. Implement the system to fulfil the requirements of Net Estate Agents.
OR
Case 4:
You decide to start a new subscription service called NewsOnScreen. The objective of your
service is to notify your subscribers of the announcements received on the VLE Blackboard
from the Department of Computer Science at USW. Subscribers can unsubscribe from
NewsOnScreen at any time when they wish to stop receiving updates (for example when
they graduate). Execute this plan as a program so you can receive subscribers for
NewsOnScreen.
 
Scenario 3
Case 5:
Your task is to improve the design of an intelligent system called MyKitchenRobo to control
electrical appliances in the Kitchen (for example ovens, blenders). Currently,
MyKitchenRobo is implemented to control the ChefOven and you see a possibility to adapt
this functionality to at least two other similar oven-type devices, the MicroWave and the
ElectricRange. Using your programming skills, update the system to be able to easily switch
between the oven-type devices.
OR
Case 6:
You have been hired by a new company called StudentCars to design their inventory
system. The company produces two models (Amaze and Awe) which differ by the number
of seats. Both the models offer the basic functionalities of a car which is to function as a
mode of transport. Additional options include adding a Radio system, Bose MP3 system,
Leather seats and Wheel illumination. Design and implement the inventory system.
